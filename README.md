# death-row-meal-analysis
A data analysis project uncovering trends in 500 death row inmates' final meal requests using SQL and Tableau.

# Death Row Meal Request Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project explores trends and patterns in last meal requests from US death row inmates. Using a publicly sourced dataset of recorded meal requests, I aimed to uncover which types of meals were most commonly requested, how preferences shifted over time, and identify notable years with unusual meal trends or refusal rates.

##  Data Source
The data for this project was sourced from the publicly available dataset on **Intro to Statistics**:

##  Tools & Technologies
 **Excel** - for handling raw data and basic data cleaning
- **PostgreSQL** â€” for advanced data cleaning, categorisation, and analysis
- **Tableau** â€” for building interactive dashboards and data visualisation
- **CSV files** â€” for storing query results and transferring data between tools

##  Project Process
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed irrelevant or duplicate entries
   - Corrected incorrect year values in the dataset
2. **Data Categorisation**
   - Categorised free-text meal requests into groups like:
     - Refused Meal
     - Dessert
     - Fried Food
     - Main Meal
     - Drink
     - Starter/Side
     - Breakfast Item
     - Other
3. **SQL Analysis**
   - Calculated total requests per year
   - Identified most popular categories overall and by year
   - Tracked trends like refusal rates and category popularity shifts
4. **Exported Clean Results**
   - Saved cleaned, aggregated data as CSV files
5. **Dashboard Build**
   - Designed and built an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualise:
     - Total requests and top-request years
     - Category popularity and % of total requests
     - Top 3 requested years
     - Category counts over time
     - Trends comparing Fried Food vs Desserts
     - Refusal rates over time

##  Key Insights
- Desserts saw a notable rise in popularity after 2000.
- 2013 had the highest refusal rate of any recorded year.
- Fried Food and Desserts consistently outperformed other categories in requests.
- The most popular category overall was 'Main Meal'.

##  Project Deliverables
- Cleaned CSV data files (`/data`)
- SQL query scripts (`/Queries`)
- Tableau dashboard packaged workbook 
- Dashboard screenshots (find attached at the bottle of the README file)
- This README file summarising the full project workflow and findings

##  Future Improvements
- Incorporate additional data like inmate demographics, state details, or execution type (if available)
- Build a live PostgreSQL-Tableau connection to allow dynamic dashboards without manual CSV exports
- Add interactive filters by category or year on the dashboard for deeper exploration
